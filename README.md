This repository is for depositing codes used in the manuscript, titled "CAG RNAs induce DNA damage and apoptosis by silencing NUDT16 expression in polyglutamine degeneration".

Two customized scripts were designed for analysis small CAG RNAs using small RNA-seq data. The usages of the two scripts are as following.
